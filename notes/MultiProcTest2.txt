Processor 1 write to address 200
1. Bus controller read in instruction
2. BC passes instruction to node, node passes it to instruction cache
3. Instruction cache passes it to L1 cache
4. L1 cache discovers it is a miss, sends instruction to request controller
5. Processor 1 request controller requests control of the bus, node 1 continues processing and uses q's like before for waiting instructions
6. Bus controller eventually grants processor 1 control of the bus
7. Request controller sends out BusReadExcl to Bus Controller
-Bus controller calls snoop method on other nodes, passing in the instruction
-Nodes return (from snoop method) a BusItem (Ack/AckI/data), if data is needed and still not given, get from memory
8. All other nodes respond with AckI's, memory responds with data to request controller of node 1
9. Node 1 relinquishes control of the bus
10. Response controller passes data to L1C which stores it and continues processing
