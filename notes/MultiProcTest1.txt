1 r 200

Processor 1 has an instruction to read address 200
-BC reads in instruction and passes to node 1
-node 1 to IC to L1C
-cycle 1
  -node1 L1C reads in instruction, sees that it is missing address
  -L1C sends request to BC
-cycle 2
  -BC grants bus to node 1, ends up seeing that there is just one node so it says all the acks are in
  -node 1 is sitting waiting on data from bus
-cycle 3
  -BC sees the acks are in, sends data back to node 1 from memory
  -node 1 sees it has something in response controller for it, pulls it in
  -stores data from address 200 and processes waiting instruction
  -passes instruction to node
-cycle 4
  -BC does nothing
  -node 1 prints out its finished instruction
-cycle 5
  -BC calls terminate on node
  -BC terminates
