Currently I have implemented the L1 Controller taking an instruction from the processor and 
sending it either to L1 Data or requesting the data from the L2 Controller
What I still need to do:
-Implement the L1 data processing things sent to it from the L1 controller
-Implement the L2 cache processing requests from the L1 Controller and either requesting data from L2 Data or from memory
  -For an eviction sent from L1 Controller, L2 Controller will check if it has that address and if it does just write it in its own data
  -If it does not have that address, fetch that address from memory and then write to it
-Need to figure out how to keep the process running until all instructions have been fully processed


Maybe have separate method for when data comes from L2 and you have to write it in L1 since you have to print stuff
you do not want to treat that write as a regular instruction?
