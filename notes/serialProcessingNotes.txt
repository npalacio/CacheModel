How do I ensure that instructions going to same address processed serially
L1C keeps track of addresses that missed and are being fetched. If an instruction comes in and is looking for one of those addresses it
is put into a queue that just waits (maybe map an address to a queue for this, a queue for each address)

Then when that data comes back the first instruction that caused the fetch is processed (That instruction should be in the QItems). 
The requested data comes back with an instruction, process that instruction then the rest of the queue (all at once)? 

So everytime data comes back from L2 we check for a queue waiting on it. 
And everytime an instruction misses we check if there is a fetch in progress already.
Same for L2?
