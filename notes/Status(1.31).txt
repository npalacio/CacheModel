To finish the project:
1. Processor needs to read in instruction file and turn that into a list of instructions to process
  a. Then pass that list to the L1 controller for processing
2. The L1 Controller takes the list of reads and writes and processes each instruction
  a.First checks if it has the memory address needed in either L1Data or Write Buffer or Victim cache
    i. If it has the data needed either write to it (no issue writing to victim cache?) or get it for a read
    ii. If it does not have the data needed, pass the instruction along to L2 
      -L2 will fetch the data and ensure that it also holds that data in it own cache
      -When L2 comes back with the data L1C will need to ensure that there is a spot to put that line
        -If the set needed for that line is full, evict one of those lines to the victim cache if clean and write buffer if dirty
      -Write the data that comes back from L2C to the open spot in L1D 
        -write new data if a write instruction otherwise write old data and then pass along the data to the proc for the read
3. L1Data must process:
  a. Read: just pass along data (L1Controller already checked if address matched and data is valid)
  b. Write: write data and be done
  c. Eviction: Move data to WB if dirty and victim cache if clean.
