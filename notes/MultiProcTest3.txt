1 r 100
2 r 200

Processor 1 read address 100, processor 2 read address 200
-Bus controller reads in instructions
-BC passes instructions to corresponding nodes
-Nodes pass instructions to their instruction caches
-BC calls process method on node 1
	-Node 1 IC passes instructions to L1C
	-L1C realizes miss for address 100
	-L1C sends instruction to request controller
	-request controller requests control of bus (puts in queue?)
-BC calls process method on node 2
	-Node 2 IC passes instruction to L1c
	-L1C realizes miss for address 200
	-L1C sends instruction to request controller
	-request controller requests control of bus
-BC grants bus to node 1
-Node 1 sends BusRd(100) to BC
-BC calls snoop on all other nodes passing in the BusRd(100) and gets BusItem's as responses
-BC realizes no data from nodes was sent so it retrieves address 100 from memory
-BC sends data back to node 1's response controller
-BC calls process method on node 1
	-Node 1
