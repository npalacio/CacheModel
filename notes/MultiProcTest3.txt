1 r 100
2 r 200

Processor 1 read address 100, processor 2 read address 200
-Bus controller reads in instructions
-BC passes instructions to corresponding nodes
-Nodes pass instructions to their instruction caches
-BC enters cycle 1
	-BC checks if anyone needs control of bus (no one does)
	-BC calls process method on node 1
		-Node 1 IC passes instructions to L1C
		-L1C realizes miss for address 100
		-L1C sends instruction to request controller
		-request controller requests control of bus (puts in queue?)
	-BC calls process method on node 2
		-Node 2 IC passes instruction to L1c
		-L1C realizes miss for address 200
		-L1C sends instruction to request controller
		-request controller requests control of bus
	-Node 1 sends BusRd(100) to BC
	-BC polls q's that hold acknowledgements from other nodes, gets nothing
-BC enters cycle 2
	-BC grants bus to node 1 and receives BusRd(100)
	-BC sends out BusRd(100) to next node that needs to receive it (2)
	-BC calls process on node 1
		-Node 1 looks for anything in its response controller, which would just be data if any or requests from other nodes -nothing there this time
			-if data found, pass from response to L1C
		-Node 1 IC loads more instructions to L1C, if any left -none left here
		-Node 1 L1C processes all instructions that it has, checking for any incoming data from ResponseController -just waiting on 100
		-Node 1 L1C sends any data requests to request controller -none
	-BC calls process on node 2
		-node 2 checks response controller for data -none there
		-node 2 calls process on IC -nothing left
		-node 2
