What should processor own?
L1Controller owns its data so it acts at the whole Level 1, and that is what the processor interacts with?
Make processor own a L1Controller object, meaning processor has to initialize all the queues for that.
Then the L1Controller will have to own the L2Controller and L2Controller owns memory. The queues are initialized by whoever owns who.
